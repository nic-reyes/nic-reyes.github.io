      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a recent Rice University grad with a degree in Mathematics and a minor in Financial Computation and Modeling. Most of the work I've done is a combination of data analysis, financial modeling, and creative problem-solving. I am currently looking for analyst roles where I can take on real-world challenges and contribute to a team of people looking to do the same.</p>
